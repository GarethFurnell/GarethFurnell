- 👋 Hi, I’m @GarethFurnell
- 👀 I’m working on Becoming a full stack developer, most of my repositories are private.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS, React, NodeJS, C#, Java, and will be moving to C++ and perhaps Carbon full time in future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on websites to begin with and contributing OOP code to smaller projects.
- 📫 How to reach me g.jfurnell@gmail.com
